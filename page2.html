    <p>Hi! My name is Madison and other than my interest in Web design, in my free time I love creating and making clothing <br>   
        Here is an example and inspiration<br>   
      <br>   
      <b>of my recent work</b> <br>  
       
      Recently I have taken interest in the movement and textile juxtapostion on knit-wear being created as structured pieces. As shown on the picture below, I love the fluidity and movement a piece can have while staying still.</a></p>
